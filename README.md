# APS-Isotherms

Designed to read and visualize the isotherms collected from APS. The isotherm collected from the APS follows
- saved as txt file
- 1st column: record of time in second
- 2nd column: record of surface area in cm^2
- 4th column: record of surface pressure in mN/m

Convert a isotherm to an instance for a better manipulation. Provide .trim method to get rid of unnecessary portions (ex. fluctuations from cleanings).
